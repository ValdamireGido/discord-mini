# discord-mini
Chrome extension that makes discord more useable in small spaces.

I highly recommend using CTRL+K to nagivate because the server and channel bars are removed. As a bonus, you could start discord in [chrome application mode](https://superuser.com/questions/33548/starting-google-chrome-in-application-mode) so that the borders and address bar won't bother you. </br> And here's how to [hide the annoying message](https://www.ghacks.net/2017/07/04/hide-chromes-disable-developer-mode-extensions-warning/) that comes up when you open Chrome and have this installed.

## Installation
Drag the extension folder into `chrome://extensions` and it should apply the style after you reload the discord page.
