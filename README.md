# discord-mini
Chrome extension that makes discord more useable in small spaces.

## Installation
Drag the extension folder into `chrome://extensions` and it should apply the style after you reload the discord page. 

I highly recommend using CTRL+K to nagivate because the server and channel bars are removed. As a bonus, you could start discord in [chrome application mode](https://superuser.com/questions/33548/starting-google-chrome-in-application-mode) for less chrome stuff to appear.
